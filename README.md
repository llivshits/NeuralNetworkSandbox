# NeuralNetworkSandbox

This is a project that I have recently started in order to teach myself more about neural networks. The current phase of the project consists of me building a simple neural network from scratch in Python that I will train on the UCI Wine Dataset and then the MNIST Wine Dataset. After this, I will build more complicated networks using more advanced tools such as PyTorch and Tensorflow.
